The tidyhelpr package is a conglomeration of useful helper function for data wrangling with the tidyverse. It is (and per se will always be) work in progress as I add a function if 

1. I construct roughly the same helper function in multiple (non-related) projects.
2. The function is nontrivial.

At the moment, tidyhelpr includes the following functions:

- `mutate_rows()` extends `dplyr::mutate()` by a predicate function parameter to apply the mutation only to rows that satisfy the predicate. Note that a similar task can be achieved by using `dplyr::if_else()` inside of `dplyr::mutate()`. However, `mutate_rows()` simplifies the code especially if multiple variables are wrangled.

- `split_groups()` is a wrapper for `dplyr::group_split()` and names the list elements by the group keys. It allows for more than one group and concatenates the individual keys.

- Ever had the struggle of reading in a csv file and realizing the relevant part starts only in line 1245? Then `read_sub()` is your friend: it lets you find the pattern for identifying the start point, splits lines and reads the relevant part via `readr::read_delim()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidyhelpr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("albutz/tidyhelpr")
```
